        <p> <h2> <i> Fun Facts about origami </i> </h2> </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Origami is derived from two Japanese words: <i>Ori </i>(folded) and <i>Kami</i> (paper). Before that, the art was called <i>orikata</i> (folded shapes).</li>
            <li> Akira Yoshizawa is considered the Grand Master of modern Origami. He created over 50,000 origami models, invented wet-folding, and developed a method of diagramming origami instructions. </li>
            <li> The fastest time to make 100 origami cranes is 40 minutes 35 seconds, achieved by Yoneyama Yuichi (Japan) in Nagoya, Japan, on 30 November 2010. Thatâ€™s an average of 24.35 seconds for each crane! </li>
            <li> An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish. </li>
